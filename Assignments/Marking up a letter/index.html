        <h1 style="font-size:18px;">Re:Eileen Dover university application</h1><br>
        Dear Eileen
        <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part<br>
        of your <abbr>PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>
        <h2 style="font-size:16px;">Starting dates</h2>
        <p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you<br>
        could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
				<li>First semester:9 September 2016</li>
				<li>Second semester:15 January 2017</li>
				<li>Third semester:2 May 2017</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
        <p>You can find more information about <a href="#">important university dates</a> on our websites.</p>

        <h3 style="font-size:16px;">Subjects of study</h3>
        <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded facility - as long as the subjects fall<br>
        somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just<br>
        the kind of person we &apos;d like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued<br>
        by are as follows, in order of priority.</p>
        <ol>
				<li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
                <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>C (86<sup>o</sup>F), when the<br>
                audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3<small>x</small>10<sup>3</sup> &gt; 3 <small>x</small>10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
                
                <li><abbr>HTML</abbr> and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you&apos;d expect the <br>
        research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we&apos;d need to know? Thanks.</p>

        <h4 style="font-size:16px;">Exotic dance moves</h4>
        <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <em>did</em> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,<br>
        my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
            <dd>A little known but <em>very</em> influential dance back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around<br>
            in a circle like chickens, to enchourage their livestock or be &quot;fruitful&quot;.</dd>
            <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
                <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which<br>
                invloved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and the shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably<br>
                tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired<br>
                modern styles such as Twerking.</dd>
            <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
            <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have<br>
            discovered a new dance style characterised by &quot;robotic&quot;, stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants<br>
            of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this<br>
            because they were really cold.</dd>
           
        </dl>

        <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
